# Lease Ease - Tenant-Landlord Communication Platform

## Project Overview

**Lease Ease** is a platform designed to enhance communication between tenants and landlords, making property management more efficient and transparent. By streamlining communication, handling maintenance requests, and tracking rent payments, Lease Ease simplifies the management process for both parties.

Effective communication between tenants and landlords is vital to resolving maintenance issues, handling rent payments, and keeping both sides informed. Without a centralized system, managing these aspects can be overwhelming. Lease Ease aims to centralize these tasks in a user-friendly platform, ensuring quick, clear, and transparent interactions between tenants and landlords.

- **Interactive Submission Form:** Tenants can report maintenance issues with step-by-step guidance. They can categorize issues, select urgency levels, and upload images or videos for better clarity.
- **Auto-Suggestions for Common Issues:** Common issues are auto-suggested as tenants type, making the reporting process faster and more accurate.
- **Real-Time Validation and Feedback:** Ensures that all information is correctly entered before submission, improving the quality of reported issues.

### 2. **Issue Tracking Dashboard**
- **Tenant View:** Tenants can track the status of submitted requests (e.g., pending, in progress, completed) using visual indicators like badges and progress bars.
- **Landlord View:** Landlords can filter and manage reported issues based on property, type, urgency, or status. Landlords can also update issue statuses to keep tenants informed.
- **Timeline of Actions:** A timeline for each request gives both tenants and landlords a clear overview of the process, from submission to resolution.

### 3. **Instant Messaging System**
- **Messaging Threads:** A chat interface for real-time communication, allowing tenants and landlords to send and receive messages easily.
- **Message Status Indicators:** Real-time indicators for message statuses such as "sent," "delivered," and "read."
- **Push Notifications and Alerts:** Notifications for new messages or changes in request status, ensuring both tenants and landlords stay updated.

### 4. **Maintenance History and Reports**
- **Maintenance Record for Properties:** Landlords can track the history of all maintenance requests per property, helping them prioritize repairs and monitor recurring issues.
- **Exportable Reports:** Landlords can export maintenance history in CSV or PDF formats for easy record-keeping and sharing with property management companies.

### 5. **Rent Payment Tracker**
- **Payment History:** Tenants can view past rent payments, due dates, and amounts, while landlords can track payment status across properties.
- **Interactive Rent Reminders:** Tenants receive reminders to mark payments as "completed" or request a delay. Landlords are instantly notified of payment statuses.

### 7. **User Profiles and Customization**
- **Personalized Tenant Profiles:** Tenants can customize their profiles with avatars, contact information, and preferred communication methods (e.g., email or SMS).
- **Landlord Management Console:** Landlords can manage multiple properties through a single dashboard and configure individual property settings.

### 8. **Interactive Maintenance Scheduling**
